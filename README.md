## Introduction
The purpose of this lab is to teach you how to use [AWS backup](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/) to achieve automatic data backup, so as to build resilient applications with well defined data backup strategy.

Create backup of the data is just first step to enhance data resilience. You as data owner must also test these backups to ensure they can be used to recover data. A backup is useless if you are unable to restore your data from it. Testing the restore process after each backup will ensure you are aware of any issues that might arise during a restore down the line.

In this lab, you will create an EC2 Instance as a data source. You will then create a strategy to backup these data sources periodically using AWS Backup, and finally, automate the testing of the restore process as well as cleanup of resources using AWS Lambda.

The skills you learn will help you define a backup and restore plan in alignment with the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/?wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-order=desc&wa-guidance-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&wa-guidance-whitepapers.sort-order=desc).
